function [Orientation] = AssignOrientation(Row, Col, Index, DoG)   
% INPUTS
%   Row - The rows of the interest points
%   Col - The columns of the interest points
%   Index - The index of the DoG that the interest point was detected in
%   DoG - The difference of gaussian images
% OUPTUTS 
%   Orientation - Array containing the orientation, in radians, of each of
%   the interest points
% This function assigns an orientation for each of the interest points
